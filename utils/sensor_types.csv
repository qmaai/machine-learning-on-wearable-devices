sensor_name,,data_dimension,relative frame,frequency/HZ,Is physical sensor?,meaning,
,,,,,,,
accelerometer,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,15,Y,"absolute acceleration projected on x,y,z axis",
,,,,,,,
ambient light sensor,,first column is in lux,,5,Y,light around,
,,,,,,,
barometer,,in hpa,,5,Y,pressure,
,,,,,,,
Game rotaion vector,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,"N, derived from gyroscope and accelerometer",angular speed projected on cell phone frame.,
,,,,,,,
gravity,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,"N,derived from accelerometer",gravity decomposed into three axis,
,,,,,,,
gyroscope ,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,Y,angular speed projected on cell phone frame.,
,,,,,,,
linear acceleration,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,"N, derived from accelerometer",acceleration without gravity,
,,,,,,,
magnetometer,,"x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,Y,magnetic field strength around the cell phone,
,,,,,,,
pedometer/step counter,,,,fired when changed,derived from accelerometer,use this to divide up steps,
,,,,,,,
rotation vector,,"xsinz,ysina,zsina,cosa,accuracy",earth frame,5,derived from accelerometer and gyroscope,"project angular degrees into x,y,z axis",a is the degree of rotation
,,,,,,,
tilt,," x,y,z",cell phone frame,5,derived from accelerometer and gyroscope,it is basically the same with game rotation vector,
,,,,,,,
mainly using these two,,linear acceleration and gyroscope.,,,,,
,,pedometer is kept for help,,,,,
